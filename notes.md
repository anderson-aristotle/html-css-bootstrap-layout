- Some devs did not understand the connection between the column/row classes and
the responsiveness of elements on the page. The diagram here tries to explain
that the syntax of `col-<breakpoint>-<size>` classes allows you to define what
breakpoint you want to listen for and what size your content should be.

- `col-xs-*` no longer exists. This has been replaced by `col-*` which will
cover anything below small screen sizes (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/)

- Modal lab should be given 20-25 minutes since devs will need to add a modal,
form, nav component, and log the data from the form.

- Even though Bootstrap defines itself as a framework, be careful with using
"framework" as it may confuse devs who might immediately think of a front-end
framework like React or Vue
